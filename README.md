### Question-1:  What is PostgreSQL?

Answere: PostgreSQL is an advanced, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for 
its strong reliability, flexibility, and support for complex queries. Itâ€™s designed to handle a wide 
range of data workloads, from small applications to large-scale, high-performance systems.


### Question-2: What is the purpose of a database schema in PostgreSQL?

Answere: In PostgreSQL, a database schema is a way to logically organize and structure data within a 
database. It defines how data is stored and relates to each other, acting as a blueprint for the 
database.

There are many key purposes of a schema in PostgreSQL such as 
1. Organizing Data
2. Namespace Management
3. Access Control
4. Modular Development
5. Simplifying Queries


### Question-3: Explain the primary key and foreign key concepts in PostgreSQL.

Answere: 
** Primary Key: 
A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. It ensures that:
i. Uniqueness
ii. Non-Nullability

** Foreign Key: 
A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key in another 
table.

### Question-4: What is the difference between the VARCHAR and CHAR data types?

Answere: 
The main difference between the VARCHAR AND CHAR is
VARCHAR can stores variable-length strings on the other hand CHAR stores fixed-length strings.
VARCHAR  is generally more storage-efficient because it only uses the space needed for the actual string
length, while


### Question-5: Explain the purpose of the WHERE clause in a SELECT statement.

Answere: The WHERE clause in a SELECT statement is used to filter records in a database query.
it's apply for every row in database to filter data with sepecific condition.


### Question-6: What are the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses used for?

Answere: 
LIMIT: The LIMIT clause restricts the number of rows returned by the query. It's used to specify how many 
rows I want to retrieve from the result set.

OFFSET: The OFFSET clause is used to skip a specified number of rows before starting to return rows from 
the query. It's commonly used in combination with LIMIT for pagination purposes.
 

### Question-7: How can you perform data modification using UPDATE statements?

Answere: The UPDATE statement specifies the row or rows I want to changed, and the expressions to be used
as the new values for specific columns in those rows. I can update statement to change single rows, 
groups of rows, or all the rows in a table.

*** Systex: 
UPDATE table_name
   SET 
       column1 = value1,
       column2 = value2
   WHERE condition;

**** Example: 
UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary * 1.10  -- Increase salary by 10%
WHERE department = 'Sales';


### Question-8: What is the significance of the JOIN operation, and how does it work in PostgreSQL?

Answere: The JOIN operation in SQL, including PostgreSQL, is used to combine rows from two or more tables
based on a related column between them. The JOIN operation is crucial for working with relational databases
because data is often normalized and stored in multiple related tables.


### Question-9: Explain the GROUP BY clause and its role in aggregation operations. 

Answere: The GROUP BY clause in SQL is used to group rows that have the same values in specified 
columns into summary rows, typically used with aggregate functions (like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), etc.). 
It allows you to perform calculations on groups of data instead of individual rows. It perfomes data
based on one or more columns.

*** Example: 
SELECT customer_id, SUM(sales_amount)
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;

### Question-10: How can you calculate aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, and AVG in PostgreSQL?

Answere: 
* COUNT: Counts the number of rows.
  command: SELECT count FROM table_name

* SUM: Adds up the values in a column.
  command: SELECT sum(column_name) FROM table_name

* AVG: Calculate the average value of a column
  command: SELECT avg(column_name) FROM table_name
